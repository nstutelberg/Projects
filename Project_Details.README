hypotheses
    #1) average disposable income per capita is positively related to the average selling price of yeezys. (TABLEAU MEAN OF SELL PRICE AND INCOME)
    #2) solid color yeezys appreciate faster than multicolored yeezys or striped yeezys (TABLEAU GROUP COLORS AND TAKE AVERAGE OR PLOT TWO LINES IN R)
    #3) higher shoe size correlates to higher resale price (REGRESSION IN R)
    #4) later order date (more recent) correlates to higher resale price. (REGRESSION IN R)

notes
    #fix a day and find the day that has the greatest variation in the cross section, a day where you have the most models being sold
    #looking for greatest degree of variation fixing the time period, CROSS SECTIONAL ANALYSIS. fix time period of sale
    #an option would be to only include common sizes so you have more observations that are more consistent

proposed plan
    #find greatest number of observations on a given day, fix time, find sale date that gives largest # of observations of each make
    #find a day with greatest number of observations for each specific shoe, regress price on shoe size and quantity of shoes that was released (probably not available)


With plotting the regression lines, In order to see the relationship for each variable, there is a separate ggplot graph for each variable. Note that the binary dependent 
      variables won't have a meaningful regression line because they are discrete values rather than continuous. However, we can still see the difference in the mean
      of each category by using a plot
